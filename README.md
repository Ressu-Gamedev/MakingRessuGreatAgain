## Contributing Guidelines

- If committing a change, use the imperative tense for messages (e.g.
`Add this file and change this feature`, not `Added this file and
changed this feature`). [This is a good read.](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Read the [Ren'Py docs](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/) if dev'ing
- Make sure pictures are exported as PNGs for better quality
- Make sure backgrounds are 720p quality (1280x720)
- Name backgrounds `bg <background name>.png`, e.g. `bg outside.png`
- Name characters `<character name> <mood/variation>.png`, e.g. `abdullah
happy.png` or `abdullah laughing 1.png`
- Contribute as much as possible :)
